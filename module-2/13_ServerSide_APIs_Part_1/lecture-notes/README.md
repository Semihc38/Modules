# Server Side APIs: Part 1

## Overview of Session

In this lesson, you will continue on with the previous days lecture example of hotel reservations. You will be replacing the fake server that you used in the previous example with a real one. If you follow the requirements that match the fake API you can wire up that same client application and it should just work.
